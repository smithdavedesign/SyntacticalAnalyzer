# SyntacticalAnalyzer
Developed a syntactical analyzer for Guile source files (.ss) to identify errors before conversion to C++. For the conversion process, it interfaces with a separate program in a different repository, implementing a predefined language. While not a comprehensive compiler, it includes support for grammar, language rules, and DFA.
